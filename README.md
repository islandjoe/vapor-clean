# Vapor Clean

Forked from Paul Hudson (github.com/twostraws/vapor-clean).

This is a template for [Vapor 3](https://vapor.codes) users that does the absolute minimum to set up a working Vapor 3 environment.

Unlike the official templates that are currently available, this template does not include vast swathes of extra example code that you will always need to delete. Instead, it adds just a single “hello” route so you can be sure everything is working correctly.
